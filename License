- `demo.mp4` or YouTube video in `/docs`  
- A short **“how it works”** paragraph with a block diagram  
- Add commit messages like:
  > “Added motor control logic”  
  > “Improved Bluetooth response timing”

Would you like me to also give you the **Arduino `.ino` code** (Bluetooth control with L298N and HC-05)?  
I can generate a clean, commented version you can directly upload.
